# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

##  Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

##  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

##  Program

```python

i=int(input())
j=int(input())

f = lambda a, b: a+b

print(f(i, j))

```

## Output

## Result

Thus,the program is executed successfully.
